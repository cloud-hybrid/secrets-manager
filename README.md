# `@cloud-technology/secrets-manager` #

`aws-cli` doesn't have the ability to select, question, or follow-up with user-input dynamically;
`@cloud-technology/secrets-manager`, interfacing both `node.js` builtin libraries and `aws-sdk` v3,
extends usability to handle input depending on data provided.

Specifically, `@cloud-technology/secrets-manager` makes using AWS' Secret-Manager via commandline
easier, faster, and more intuitive.
